welcome
Ez a rész megy a képre:
Welcome, beautiful soul.
Like a wave meeting the shore, you've arrived—right on time.
This space is your exhale. A place to pause, reflect, and reconnect. Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, lost in life’s noise, or simply tired of treading water, you're not alone.
I’m not just a therapist. I’m your calm in the chaos. Your quiet supporter. The one who listens without judgment and walks beside you as you find your footing again.
Ez megy a kép alá:
You don’t need to have all the answers. You don’t need to believe in anything beyond the possibility that things can feel lighter. EFT tapping works with or without faith, spirituality, or a set belief system.
So take a breath. Let the tide roll in. Healing begins here.
Your Compass to Healing and Serenity
Here, you're invited to gently return to yourself—with tools that calm the waters and help you navigate life with more ease and clarity.
These are just some of the practices we might explore together:
Emeljük ki a technikákat , kint ahogy az ezelőttibe:
EFT Tapping: Release emotional patterns and reconnect with your inner balance.
Access Bars: Lightly touch points on the head to help clear limiting beliefs and invite new possibilities.
The Work by Byron Katie: Gently question your thoughts and create space for peace to return.
Forgiveness Practices: Whether through Ho’oponopono or guided meditation, find shelter from emotional storms.
Higher Guidance Tools: Angel cards and a pendulum offer a way to listen—both inward and upward.
Intuitive “Love” Massage: A soothing space to soften tension, quiet the mind, and come home to self-love.
And this is only the beginning. I’m always learning, always growing—because healing is a journey, and life itself is our greatest teacher.

Techniques I Use Intuitively
Whether you find strength in something greater, believe in energy, intuition, or just trust in the power of a deep breath and a good cup of coffee—these techniques can meet you where you are.
No need for fixed beliefs or spiritual labels. EFT tapping and the other practices I offer are grounded in experience, compassion, and connection—and they work for anyone open to exploring change.
Bringing Healing to You
Sometimes, nothing beats that in-person connection. As a mobile therapist, I’m often on the move—ready to bring calm, comfort, and care right to your doorstep.
Whether it’s an intuitive massage, an EFT tapping session, or just a grounding, heart-to-heart chat, I offer personalized, in-person experiences designed around you. There’s something special about receiving support in the comfort of your own space—and I’m here for it.
If I’m in town (and fingers crossed you are too!), let’s make it happen. Or if you’d prefer to come to me, I also have a peaceful treatment room ready and waiting.
Fancy something a bit different?
Why not host a friends & family treatment week? Think of it as a mini wellness retreat—right in your living room. Laughter, relaxation, and good vibes included. (Curious? Just reach out and ask me about it.)
