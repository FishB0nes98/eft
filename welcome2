Welcome to Your Journey of Healing with Chill To You!
Ahoy, beautiful soul! Welcome to my little oasis in the vast sea of the internet. I'm not just your average therapist; I'm your personal cheerleader, confidant, and trusted guide on this thrilling voyage called life. Think of me as the friend you always wished for—a listener, a laugh-sharer, and a hand-holder through the stormy seas.
Are you seeking answers to life's puzzles? Perhaps you're navigating through traumas, looking to release stress, or simply craving a listening ear? You've dropped anchor in the right place! I'm here to help you chart your course to calmer waters.
Don't worry if you don’t feel that "mystery" within yourself. No need to believe in Buddha, God, Angels, or anything like that. EFT tapping works either way. Just lean back and let me help you steer your boat to shore.
Your Compass to Healing and Serenity
I've got a treasure chest full of techniques to help you find your way:
Emotional Freedom with EFT Tapping: Recognize patterns that drive your life.
Access BARS: Release old beliefs by touching your head, re-wiring your brain.
The Work by Byron Katie: A map to question and transform your suffering.
Forgiveness Tools: Ho'oponopono or guided meditation to help you weather emotional storms.
Higher Power Connection: Use Angel cards and a Pendulum to seek wisdom from within and from a higher power.
Intuitive “Love” Massage: Experience joy and self-love, smoothing out nerves and bringing you back to unconditional love.
And that's just the beginning! I'm always learning, always expanding my horizons through training and self-awareness. Life, after all, is the greatest teacher of them all.
Why Choose Chill To You?
Heartfelt Connection: I believe in creating a safe, judgment-free zone where you can be yourself. No masks, no pretenses—just you and me, exploring your journey together.
Holistic Approach: Mind, soul, and body in sync is the way! Without it, it isn’t possible to be whole and in balance. Life's not one-size-fits-all, and neither is healing. I blend techniques like EFT tapping, pendulum work, and intuitive massage (offline option) —just to name a few in my repertoire—to create a personalized path just for you.
Humor and Heart: Because let's face it, life's too short to be serious all the time! I'll keep you laughing (or crying—both cleanse your soul) while we navigate the ups and downs.
Empowerment: I'm here to equip you with tools to face life's challenges head-on. You're the hero of your story, and I'm just here to cheer you on and gently steer the wheel towards your right path.
Flexible Options: Online and offline options, whichever suits you best.
Come to You: Oh yeah, you can get this option too. Imagine your whole family and friends healing together without having to brave the stormy waters. Or your employers deserve a reward and you have decided to give them a healing session? A week of bliss with therapy, healing touch, serenity, massage. Spa and wellness brought right to your home.
