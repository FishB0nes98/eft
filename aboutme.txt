Beyond Therapy: Crafting
When I'm not guiding others on their healing journey, I enjoy creating with my hands. From making jewelry with natural materials like feathers and minerals to crocheting, I find joy in crafting unique pieces for individuals. Collaborating with customers to create something special is very uplifting. This creative hobby not only relaxes me but also brings immense joy to my customers, reminding me of the beauty in every moment. Plus, it's a great excuse to meditate all day long.
My Journey
My path to becoming a therapist was anything but conventional. From a young age, I was a sensitive soul, often feeling like a marshmallow in a microwave—squishy, sensitive, and ready to explode with emotions. This sensitivity led me down a winding road of self-discovery, where I learned to transform my vulnerabilities into strengths. Think of it like sailing on a rough sea; sometimes you get splashed, but you also get to see some amazing sunsets!

Growing up, I dreamed of being a doctor to heal my mum. Life had other plans, and I ended up as a hairdresser! From healing hands to styling hands—almost the same, right? Not really! Talk about a plot twist! Little did I know that all that listening to clients' problems would come in handy later. Years passed, and I moved countries, traveling half the world. I picked up a few occupations along the way like beauty, makeup artist, nail technician, but life had different plans for me than staying in the beauty biz.
It was during my time on a cruise ship that I discovered the power of touch and the healing potential of massage. I went to learn massages and I became a certified massage therapist (Swedish massage, Deep Tissue massage, and Thai Yoga massage). But anatomy didn't interest me. I was interested in the "touch" part.
I knew there was more to the story, and I was determined to find it. My breakthrough came when I delved deep into my own traumas and learned techniques to help myself to come out of a panic attack and later on to heal. This personal transformation not only changed my life but also inspired me to share these powerful tools with others. Today, I am passionate about helping individuals like you find clarity, peace, and empowerment through spiritual healing and EFT tapping. "Love" massage is just icing on my cake.
