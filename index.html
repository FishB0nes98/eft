                <p class="hero-subtitle">Ahoy, beautiful soul! Welcome to my little oasis in the vast sea of the
                    internet. I'm not just your average therapist; I'm your personal cheerleader, confidant, and trusted
                    guide on this thrilling voyage called life. Think of me as the friend you always wished for—a
                    listener, a laugh-sharer, and a hand-holder through the stormy seas.</p>

                    <p>Are you seeking answers to life's puzzles? Perhaps you're navigating through traumas, looking to
                        release stress, or simply craving a listening ear? You've dropped anchor in the right place! I'm
                        here to help you chart your course to calmer waters.</p>
                    <p>Don't worry if you don't feel that "mystery" within yourself. No need to believe in Buddha, God,
                        Angels, or anything like that. EFT tapping works either way. Just lean back and let me help you
                        steer your boat to shore.</p>

                <h2>Your Compass to Healing and Serenity</h2>
                <p>I've got a treasure chest full of techniques to help you find your way:</p>

                <ul class="services-list">
                    <li><strong>Emotional Freedom with EFT Tapping:</strong> Recognize patterns that drive your life.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Access BARS:</strong> Release old beliefs by touching your head, re-wiring your brain.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The Work by Byron Katie:</strong> A map to question and transform your suffering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forgiveness Tools:</strong> Ho'oponopono or guided meditation to help you weather
                        emotional storms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher Power Connection:</strong> Use Angel cards and a Pendulum to seek wisdom from
                        within and from a higher power.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intuitive "Love" Massage:</strong> Experience joy and self-love, smoothing out nerves
                        and bringing you back to unconditional love.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>And that's just the beginning! I'm always learning, always expanding my horizons through training and
                    self-awareness. Life, after all, is the greatest teacher of them all.</p>

                            masks? Not here! I'm all about creating a safe space where you can ditch the disguise and
                            just be you. No judgment, no pressure—just a cozy corner where you can unpack your life's

                            over the place! I blend techniques like EFT tapping, pendulum work, and intuitive massage
                            (offline option) to create a healing cocktail just for you. Think of it as a spa day for

                            keep you chuckling (or crying—both are great for the soul) while we navigate the twists and
                            turns. After all, laughter is the best medicine, and I've got a prescription for you!</p>
