                    <p><em>"I consider Csilla to be a very authentic helper, who herself has gone through all the techniques she uses to help her clients regarding her own life's obstacles. And since she has been through a lot herself, there is nothing that could surprise or scare her - you can talk to her about anything with complete confidence, knowing that she can handle it, and this is incredibly reassuring!</em></p>
                    
                    <p><em>She is also extremely empathetic and pays maximum attention to her clients. When working with her, each time I feel that her focus is completely on me and on our work, she holds the space for the work with a laser sharp focus, but at the same time with a warm heart and complete acceptance. Thanks to her developed intuition and close connection with the spiritual world, she very quickly senses the root of a problem, which she then helps to solve with the help of her wide repertoire of tools.</em></p>
                    
                    <p><em>She doesn't stop the EFT process until there's even a tiny bit of the problem left (we had a tapping session where the intensity of the problem was going down from 10/10 one by one, nevertheless she still patiently followed the process until arriving at 0).</em></p>
                    
                    <p><em>During the pendulum sessions she surrenders herself to the higher guidance with great humility and modesty, checking even during the process many times whether her own consciousness or expectations are not interfering, or whether the process is not being disturbed by other factors. This is particularly reassuring, as thus you can entrust yourself to her in complete faith. I also learned that it is worth listening to the pendulum's messages, because they are very accurate!</em></p>
                    
                    <p><em>Long story short: I recommend Csilla with all my heart to anyone who really wants to progress and finally move forward from being stuck!"</em></p>

Speaking about the stories and the subsequent emotions with Chilly allowed her to narrow down the focus of my problem to the root cause. She then developed key statements for me to 'tap on'.

I became detached from the stories and as a result they lost their power over me.</em></p>
                            <p><em>It was truly surprising to find how impactful removing emotions from stories can be. It totally transformed my attitude towards my work. No longer was I feeling anger and anxiety. Instead, I was able to approach work with a calmness and detachment that allowed me to make good decisions. The result was staggering. My reality transformed completely. The problems I was facing at work simply ceased to exist. I believe this was the result of the change in my personal vibration level, as negative, low vibration emotions were removed.</em></p>
                            <p><em>This treatment left a strong impression on me. I feel like I now have a powerful tool to help me through my life experiences. I will be working with Chilly again and have decided to try a package treatment combining the positive effects of EFT, energy healing and massage she offers."</em></p>

                            <p><em>"My first EFT session was like nothing I could have imagined. I went in with no expectations, yet I truly opened up in a way I had never imagined. Chilly's warm, grounded presence made me feel completely safe – safe enough to let some of my deepest traumas surface.</em></p>
                            <p><em>This trauma was one of the most significant I had ever carried, and while it didn't go away immediately, the release began in that session. What unfolded between us was a deeply connected experience. I felt in tune with Chilly, and it was clear that she felt the same. The energetic shift was like nothing I had ever experienced before – waves of mixed emotions, from sadness to laughter. Yes, we even cried and laughed together.</em></p>
                            <p><em>It was beautiful.</em></p>
                            <p><em>I have been lighter every day since that first session. My energy is stronger, I feel better and I have the will to live. The second and third were faster. My other traumas have become weaker, they no longer control my emotional world.</em></p>
                            <p><em>If there is something in your life that is holding you back – emotionally, mentally, energetically – I encourage you to consider a few sessions with Chilly. Her intuition, compassion and abilities create a space for true healing. I can only recommend her 105%."</em></p>

Chilly comes to my home fully prepared, bringing everything needed to create a relaxing environment. From the moment she arrived, it was clear that she was dedicated to providing a top-notch experience. Chilly's attention to detail and professionalism are evident in every aspect of the session. The atmosphere she creates is incredibly soothing, making it easy to unwind and fully immerse myself in the therapy. Each session not only leaves me feeling rejuvenated but also completely refreshed, as if a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, ready to take on the world anew.

Leaving the treatment, I felt full of energy and got a really calm sleep that night. Over the next few days, I was in a really productive mood and wanted to achieve so much.
