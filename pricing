Your Journey to Emotional Freedom Starts Here
Each session lasts between 90-100 minutes, giving us plenty of time to dive deep into your emotions and work through any challenges you're facing. If you need more time, consider a double session—200 minutes of undivided attention, booked at once. It's perfect for those who want to tackle deeper issues or simply prefer a longer, more immersive experience.
To ensure we're the perfect match, I offer a complimentary 20-minute video call before we book your first session. It's a no-obligation consultation, because we both need to be sure we click!
Once you're ready to take the plunge, simply pay for your session beforehand, and we'll secure your appointment. Easy peasy!
Invest in Your Well-being
I believe in the power of commitment and dedication. That's why I offer bundle prices for clients who have worked with me before and are eager to continue their healing journey. These bundles ensure that we're both invested in your growth and transformation.

Recommended Session Frequency
For "fast lane" results, I recommend at least 2 sessions per week. However, everyone is unique, and so is their healing journey. Some clients prefer to sit with it for a while after session , others are prefer more frequent sessions, even daily, for a more intensive experience. We'll discuss the ideal frequency for you, tailoring our approach to your specific needs and goals.
