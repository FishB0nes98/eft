I consider Csilla to be a very authentic helper, who herself has gone through all the techniques she uses to help her clients regarding her own life's obstacles. And since she has been through a lot herself, there is nothing that could surprise or scare her - you can talk to her about anything with complete confidence, knowing that she can handle it, and this is incredibly reassuring!
She is also extremely empathetic and pays maximum attention to her clients. When working with her, each time I feel that her focus is completely on me and on our work, she holds the space for the work with a laser sharp focus, but at the same time with a warm heart and complete acceptance. Thanks to her developed intuition and close connection with the spiritual world, she very quickly senses the root of a problem, which she then helps to solve with the help of her wide repertoire of tools.
She doesn't stop the EFT process until there's even a tiny bit of the problem left (we had a tapping session where the intensity of the problem was going down from 10/10 one by one, nevertheless she still patiently followed the process until arriving at 0).
During the pendulum sessions she surrenders herself to the higher guidance with great humility and modesty, checking even during the process many times whether her own consciousness or expectations are not interfering, or whether the process is not being disturbed by other factors. This is particularly reassuring, as thus you can entrust yourself to her in complete faith. I also learned that it is worth listening to the pendulum's messages, because they are very accurate!J
Long story short: I recommend Csilla with all my heart to anyone who really wants to progress and finally move forward from being stuck!
