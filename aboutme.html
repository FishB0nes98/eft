            <div class="container">
                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>Ever felt like a marshmallow in a microwave? That was me for years—squishy, sensitive, and ready to explode with feelings at the slightest touch. I had this overwhelming desire to help everyone, even if it meant listening to their problems all day (spoiler alert: it did!). I just didn't have the tools to help, only to listen.</p>
                <p>Growing up, I dreamed of being a doctor to heal my mom forever. Life, however, had other plans. I ended up as a hairdresser! Can you imagine? From healing hands to styling hands. Almost the same, right? Not really! Talk about a plot twist!</p>
                <p>But life had different plans for me than staying in the beauty industry, even though I learned so many other occupations like beauty therapy, nail tech, and makeup artistry. It was when I learned different massage techniques that something clicked. I never cared much for the muscle part, even though I love giving a Swedish massage and relaxing those muscles. The touch part was always more interesting to me. I felt that was something I could work with. Very few therapists have that essence, that unique care, and I had always missed that. Now I know why. That's what we never really get, not from our parents as babies nor from our partners. That's where I come in.</p>
                <p>So, for all the heartache and experiences I went through, I started looking for answers and connections. I went deep into self-discovery and healing, which made me who I am today. Learning these techniques changed my life and the lives of my friends, so I realized I needed to share this with those who need my energy, knowledge, and unique touch.</p>
                <p>My knowledge isn't just from books and studies. Most of my ways are self-discovery and personal experiences, even though I've done a lot of training in different fields from massage therapy to spiritual techniques.</p>

        <section id="my-approach" class="content-section">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <p>I believe in the power of holistic healing to transform lives. Mind, body, and soul need to be connected for true wellness. Each person is unique, and so is their path to wellness. I work intuitively, like a human pendulum, swinging between techniques to address what your body and soul truly need. Whether it's through EFT tapping, pendulum work, or intuitive massage, I'm here to guide you with honesty, empathy, and care. Oh, and a healthy dose of humor because, let's face it, life's too short to be serious all the time!</p>
                <p>Think of me as your spiritual GPS, helping you navigate the twists and turns of your healing journey. I'm not just here to fix you; I'm here to empower you to fix yourself. With a blend of ancient wisdom and modern techniques, I create a safe space for you to explore, heal, and grow.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Connecting with You</h2>
                <p>I offer both online and offline sessions. As a traveling therapist, I might just be in your town tomorrow—you never know, I don't either! I also provide specialized offline treatments, such as intuition massage and "love" body massage (please keep in mind that it is non-sexual and focused on healing and serenity). Think of it as a spa day for your soul!</p>

                <h2>Beyond Therapy</h2>
                <p>When I'm not guiding others on their healing journey, you can find me creating something with my hands. From making jewelry with natural materials to crocheting, I find joy in crafting unique pieces from nature. This creative outlet not only relaxes me but also reminds me of the beauty in every moment. Plus, it's a great excuse to meditate all day long.</p>
