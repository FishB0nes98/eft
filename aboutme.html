                <p class="hero-subtitle">Hello, beautiful soul! Welcome to Chill To You, where healing meets
                    transformation. I'm Chilly, your spiritual and EFT tapping therapist, and your personal cheerleader
                    with more hugs and less pom-poms. As a traveling therapist, you never know where I'll pop up
                    next—neither do I! I work intuitively, like a human pendulum, swinging between techniques to address
                    what your body and soul truly need.</p>

                    <p>I'm dedicated to guiding you on a journey of self-discovery, empowerment, and personal growth.
                        With a unique blend of spirituality, the powerful technique of Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)
                        tapping, and a touch of warmth with some humor, I help individuals overcome emotional blocks,
                        heal from past traumas, and unlock their true potential.</p>

                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <div class="intro-text">
                    <p>My path to becoming a therapist was anything but conventional. From a young age, I was a
                        sensitive soul, often feeling like a marshmallow in a microwave—squishy, sensitive, and ready to
                        explode with emotions. This sensitivity led me down a winding road of self-discovery, where I
                        learned to transform my vulnerabilities into strengths. Think of it like sailing on a rough sea;
                        sometimes you get splashed, but you also get to see some amazing sunsets!</p>
                    <p>Growing up, I dreamed of being a doctor to heal my mum. Life had other plans, and I ended up as
                        a
                        hairdresser! From healing hands to styling hands—almost the same, right? Not really! Talk about
                        a plot twist! Little did I know that all that listening to clients' problems would come in handy
                        later. Years passed, and I moved countries, traveling half the world. I picked up a few
                        occupations along the way like beauty, make up artist, nail technician but life had different
                        plans for me than staying in the beauty biz.</p>
                    <p>It was during my time on a cruise ship that I discovered the power of touch and the healing
                        potential of massage. I went to learn massages and I became a certified massage therapist
                        (Swedish massage, Deep Tissue massage and Thai Yoga massage). But anatomy didn't interest me. I
                        was interested in the "touch" part.</p>
                    <p>I knew there was more to the story, and I was determined to find it.</p>
                    <p>My breakthrough came when I delved deep into my own traumas and learned techniques to help
                        myself
                        to come out of a panic attack and later on to heal. This personal transformation not only
                        changed my life but also inspired me to share these powerful tools with others. Today, I am
                        passionate about helping individuals like you find clarity, peace, and empowerment through
                        spiritual healing and EFT tapping. "Love" massage is just icing on my cake.</p>

                    <p>As a spiritual and EFT tapping therapist, I believe in a holistic approach to healing that
                        connects mind, body, and soul. Each person's journey is unique, and I work intuitively to
                        address your true needs. My approach is gentle yet powerful, providing a safe space for you to
                        explore your emotions, release old patterns that doesn't belong to you, and embrace your
                        authentic self.</p>
                    <p>I hold space for you to realise, recover and explore your own feelings.</p>

                <div class="services-list">
                    <p>I help individuals overcome emotional blocks, heal from past traumas, and unlock their true
                        potential. Here are some of the areas where my clients have seen remarkable transformations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Emotional Healing & Freedom:</strong> Overcome past traumas, release emotional
                            blocks, and find inner peace. Clients report feeling more at ease and present in their daily
                            lives.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spiritual Growth & Awakenings:</strong> Connect with your higher self, gain clarity
                            on your life's purpose, and experience profound spiritual awakenings. Some clients find a
                            deeper connection to the universe and a sense of purpose and peace.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stress & Anxiety Management:</strong> Use EFT tapping to manage stress, anxiety, and
                            other emotional challenges by tapping into your body's energy meridians to restore balance
                            and promote healing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Energy Healing & Vitality:</strong> Balance your energy fields, promote physical
                            well-being, and enhance your overall vitality.</li>

                            the patterns that drive your life, improve self-awareness, and make positive changes. Many
                            clients report a boost in self-esteem and self-worth, feeling more confident and deserving
                            of love and success.</li>

                <div class="intro-text">
                    <p>When I'm not guiding others on their healing journey, I enjoy creating with my hands. From
                        making
                        jewellery with natural materials like feathers and minerals to crocheting, I find joy in
                        crafting unique pieces for individuals. Collaborating with customers to create something special
                        is very uplifting. This creative hobby not only relaxes me but also brings immense joy to my
                        customers, reminding me of the beauty in every moment. Plus, it's a great excuse to meditate all
                        day long.</p>
