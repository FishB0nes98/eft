Chill To You: Your Wave of Well-Being
Techniques I Use Intuitively
Believe in the spiritual realm, a Higher Power, the Universe, or just the power of a good cup of coffee—whatever your belief, it will work for you. EFT tapping is for everyone!
EFT Tapping
Ever heard of EFT, or Emotional Freedom Techniques, affectionately known as "Tapping"? It's like giving your emotions a gentle nudge in the right direction. By tapping on specific points on your body while focusing on what's bothering you, EFT helps you tackle both emotional and physical issues. Think of it as a spa day for your mind and body.
Benefits of EFT Tapping:
Reduces stress, both emotional and physical
Helps you overcome pesky issues and emotions
Provides mental clarity and a sense of empowerment
Available anytime, anywhere—even in the middle of a traffic jam
EFT isn't just a technique; it's your ticket to emotional freedom and a happier, healthier life. 
Note: EFT is like trying a new recipe—experimental, but delicious if you do it right. You're in charge of your well-being, so tap away!
Access Bars
Access Bars is like a spiritual tune-up for your brain. By gently touching 32 points on your head, we release beliefs that are holding you back. Each point is connected to different aspects of your life, like communication, money, creativity, and more. It's like hitting the reset button on your life's software. Unlike Reiki, Access Bars is all about clearing out the cobwebs to give you a fresh start.

The Work by Byron Katie
Ever feel like your thoughts are running the show? Byron Katie's "The Work" is here to challenge that. With four simple questions and a "turnaround," you'll be looking at your thoughts from a whole new angle. It's like giving your mind a makeover, one thought at a time. The goal? More peace, more freedom, and a whole lot less stress.
Hoʻoponopono
Hoʻoponopono is a Hawaiian practice that's all about forgiveness and reconciliation. It's like giving your inner conflicts a big ol' hug and telling them it's time to move on. By addressing and resolving these inner turmoils, you can positively influence your external world. Think of it as a spiritual spring cleaning for your soul.
Angel Cards and Pendulums
Angel cards and pendulums are like your spiritual GPS. Angel cards offer messages and perspectives, while pendulums provide yes/no answers and more. It's like having a direct hotline to your Higher-self. They're great for clarifying or confirming messages from other divination methods. Think of them as your spiritual sidekicks. I am not a fortune teller. I just "hand over" the message your higher self is telling you.
Intuitive "Love" Massage: A Unique Experience
Ever wished for a massage that's more about love than muscles? Welcome to the world of Intuitive "Love" Massage. It's a healing experience that reconnects you with pure, unconditional love. Imagine being touched with the same care and affection you might have longed for as a child. This massage is about feeling that divine softness and acceptance that we all deserve. It's gentle, intuitive, and all about releasing blockages and allowing love to flow into your being. Unlike Swedish massage, this process is more about energies than muscles.
During a session, you'll experience a deep state of relaxation, like finding a golden key to happiness and better health. It's a way of loving yourself that you might not have experienced before. This massage affects the soul through the body, using oil with long, stroking movements, harmonizing and balancing your physical, mental, and spiritual energies.
Please note: This is NOT a sexual service. Please, find someone else for that kind of release and pleasure.
Combined Treatment: A Blissful Journey
If you're feeling adventurous, why not book a combined treatment? I blend techniques for faster and more effective results. Picture this: we meet offline in your preference place (at my treatment room or at your home or venue. We chat about your problem, address it with EFT Tapping, follow up with an intuitive massage to release more blockages, and end with an Access Bars treatment to soothe those nerves or a “Love massage.” You'll be so relaxed, you might just float away. I can tailor it to your needs, but be prepared for a blissful 3.5-hour journey.
