FAQ for Holistic Therapy with Chilly
1. About EFT Tapping
Q: What is EFT Tapping and how does it work?
A: EFT Tapping, or Emotional Freedom Technique, is like giving your emotions a gentle nudge towards peace. You tap on specific points on your body while focusing on the issue you want to release. It's like a mini acupuncture session without the needles, helping to balance your energy and calm your mind. EFT Tapping has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and even physical pain by lowering cortisol levels and promoting relaxation, as well as performance enhancement. As Gary Craig says: “EFT, by far, is the most fascinating, most rewarding, most effective tool I have ever found for personal improvement. Try it on anything!”

Many folks have found it to be a game-changer for managing those pesky negative emotions. Studies have shown that EFT can lead to a significant decrease in anxiety levels.
Q: What are some common misconceptions about EFT Tapping?
A: One common misconception is that EFT Tapping is just a placebo.

Another misconception is that it requires a lot of time and practice to see results, but many people experience benefits even after their first session.
Q: How can I prepare for an EFT Tapping session?
A: It's helpful to have a quiet space, some tissues and water nearby, and a pen and paper to jot down any insights or emotions that arise, although I will do the writing, so you just need to focus on yourself. Make sure before the session that your device is charged and the lighting is good, as I need to see you properly to help you through your process. Remember, there's no need to have expectations about how the session should go; easing into the process often leads to the best results.
Q: What should I expect during an EFT Tapping session?
A: During an EFT Tapping session, you'll be guided to focus on a particular issue while tapping on specific points on your body. It's common to experience a range of emotions, and some people may feel a sense of release or relief. I will always tell you everything and guide you through the process. No need to worry. Easy peasy!
Q: Can EFT Tapping be used for physical ailments as well?

Q: How do I know if EFT Tapping is right for me?

I will teach you how. Many people find that EFT Tapping provides them with a sense of empowerment and control over their emotions.
Q: What is the recommended session frequency?
A: You might just need one session to put something into place in your life. If you are more committed for "fast lane" results, I recommend at least two sessions per week. However, everyone is unique, and so is their healing journey. Some clients prefer to sit with it for a while after a session, while others prefer more frequent sessions, even daily, for a more intensive experience. We'll discuss the ideal frequency for you, tailoring our approach to your specific needs and goals.
